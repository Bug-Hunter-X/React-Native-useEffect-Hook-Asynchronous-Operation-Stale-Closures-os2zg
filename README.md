# React Native useEffect Hook Asynchronous Operation Stale Closures

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving the use of the `useEffect` hook with asynchronous operations.  The code shows how stale closures can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.

## Problem

The example `MyComponent` makes a network request within a `useEffect` hook.  If the request takes a long time, and the component re-renders before the request completes, the `setData` callback inside the `fetchData` function might be referencing an outdated component instance. This results in the update not being reflected in the UI, or potentially even causing errors.

## Solution

The solution involves using techniques such as abort controllers or checking whether the component is still mounted before updating the state. This prevents stale closures and ensures that the UI updates correctly even when asynchronous operations are involved.
